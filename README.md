# Image-Based Detection of Rice Leaf Diseases Using Deep CNN Models

## Description
Implemented deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models to classify and detect rice leaf diseases from image data. Applied image preprocessing, training, and evaluation to develop an automated disease detection system with high accuracy.

## Features
- Image classification for rice leaf diseases  
- Preprocessing techniques for image normalization  
- Deep CNN model architecture with TensorFlow/Keras
- Evaluation using error rate, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Comparison with traditional classifiers (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM)  
- Multiple train-test split evaluations (30:70, 40:60, 50:50, 60:40, 70:30)

## Dataset
Rice leaf disease dataset from Mendeley Data:
